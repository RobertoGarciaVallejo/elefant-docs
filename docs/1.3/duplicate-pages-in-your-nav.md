# Duplicate pages in your nav

If you want a page to appear in more than one place in your dynamic navigation, here's how you can do it:

1. Create a duplicate page with the same title and a new page ID
2. In the body, click on the `Dynamic Objects` icon
3. Select `Pages: Redirect Link` and enter the link to the original page (e.g., `/original-page-id`)
4. Save this page then go to Tools > Navigation
5. Add the new page to the secondary location in the site tree

In this way, you maintain more control over your pages and your site tree than maintaining virtual aliases within the navigation tool.
