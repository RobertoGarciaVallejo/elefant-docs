# Comparison to Sitellite CMS

Elefant was based on a lot of the same ideas behind [Sitellite](http://www.sitellite.org/), but updated based on what I felt were flaws or limitations in Sitellite's approach, or things that are now able to be done better using new features of PHP. Here is a comparison of some of the key aspects, for Sitellite app developers to use in porting apps to Elefant.
