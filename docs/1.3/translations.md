# Translations

We hope to make this more streamlined in the future. For now, to translate Elefant into a new language and submit it for inclusion in the project, here are the steps:

1. Install a copy of Elefant from the [latest master branch on Github](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant). You can do this through Git, or by clicking the Zip button on the page.

2. Once you have Elefant installed, go to Tools > Languages. It will first build an index of all the text in the default install, then present you with a list of languages. Click `Add language` to add a new one.

3. Enter the language name, code, etc. [See here](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) for a list of language codes. We recommend entering the language name in its own language, for example `Français` instead of `French` or `Español` instead of `Spanish`.

4. Once the language has been added, click `Edit` to edit its translations. There are approximately 1434 words in total.

Once you've finished translating, post the translation file, found in the `lang` folder of your installation, to one of these sites and link to it in the [Elefant forum](/forum/) under the I18n category.
