# Theme builder

Here are a few theme options you can use that integrate with popular CSS frameworks (based on [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/)).

1. Select a framework:

<iframe src=""/themebrowser/builder"" frameborder=""0"" border=""0"" width=""100%"" height=""150"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>

2. Unzip the download and drop the `boilerplate.html` file and `boilerplate` folder into your `/layouts/` folder.

3. **Optional**: Rename `boilerplate.html` and the `boilerplate` folder. Be sure to search & replace references in the HTML for `boilerplate` to the new folder name.

4. Under Elefant Admin > Tools > Designer, set the new layout file to be the default.

5. Edit to add your custom stylings.

### What's included

* `boilerplate.html` - A pre-built layout template that includes all of the necessary Elefant tags needed for a typical website, as well as your chosen HTML5/CSS framework.
* `boilerplate/css` - Stylesheets you can customize to achieve your desired look & feel. See `style.css` and `mobile.css` to add your custom styles.
* `boilerplate/js` - JavaScript files used in the pre-built layout ([Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) in the Responsive and HTML5 Boilerplate downloads). Feel free to add your own here as well.
* `boilderplate/pix` - Images used in the pre-built layout, including favicon and iPhone/iPad icons.
