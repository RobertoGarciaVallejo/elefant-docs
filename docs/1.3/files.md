# Files

Elefant includes a basic file upload and management interface under Tools > Files.

From here, you can create folders and upload any type of file, as well as rename, download, or delete the files.

Files can then be linked to through the [[WYSIWYG Editor]].

MP3 files will be shown as an embedded audio player, and MP4 files will be shown as an embedded video player. SWF files will show as embedded flash, and common image types (JPG, GIF, and PNG) will embed themselves into the page as well. Other file types will simply appear as links to download the file.
