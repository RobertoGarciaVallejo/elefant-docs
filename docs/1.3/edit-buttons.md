# Edit Buttons

Elefant's main editing interface provides in-context edit buttons wherever content appears on your website that you can edit. This makes your website itself the primary user interface of the software, making it extremely intuitive to find pages simply by browsing your website for them.

Once you're on the page you want to edit, you can click on the edit button that appears at the top of the page body while you're logged in as an admin. This is how the edit buttons will appear on your page:

The buttons, from left to right, are:

* **Add Page** - Add a new page to your site
* **Edit Page** - Edit the current page
* **Versions** - View the edit history for the current page
* **Delete Page** - Delete the current page

## Content blocks

You may also see edit buttons on sidebars and other areas of the page. These areas are called content blocks. Content blocks also have the following edit buttons:

* **Edit Block** - Edit the content block
* **Versions** - View the edit history for the content block
* **Delete Block** - Delete the content block
